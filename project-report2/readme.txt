Update:

Shows the user's BMI value once they have provided their information. Based on the BMI code's value, it indicates whether the user is overweight or underweight and offers recommendations for the kinds of things he should eat to raise his BMI. That my application is displaying the correct BMI and recommending a diet based on that makes me pleased.
