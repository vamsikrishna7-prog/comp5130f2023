For this project, we've utilized XAMP as the server and a MySQL database. To improve the user interface, modifications were made to the java script and CSS. The application will now enter the user's details, including name, password, email, phone number, and BMI, into the database. The user is prompted to enter their height and weight after logging onto the program, after which it will calculate their BMI and recommend various extreme and diet regimens. The fact that our program stores user data in a database makes me proud.
