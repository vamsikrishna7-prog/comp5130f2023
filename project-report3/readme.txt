UPDATE:

Displays the bmi value when user has entered his details and depending on the value of the bmi code displays that if that person is over/under weight. And also suggests the type of foods that he needs to consume inorder to gain the right BMI. Started to work on the database where it can store the details of the user.  I am happy about the fact that my application is displaying the right bmi value and suggesting the diet according to that.
