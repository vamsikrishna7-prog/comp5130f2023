Made a welcome page asking users to join up or log in. Following the signing up or signing in button and form completion, the user is taken to a BMI page where they are prompted to input their height and weight. The user's BMI index is then shown on the screen depending on the information they have provided. This is the first time I've used JavaScript to calculate a user's BMI and display it on the screen. hence I'm really happy with it.
